# DashReader

**Speed reading plugin** using **RSVP** (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique.

![DashReader Demo](dashreader.gif)

## What is RSVP?

**RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)** is a speed reading technique that displays text one word at a time in the same fixed location on screen. This eliminates eye movement and allows your brain to focus entirely on comprehension, enabling reading speeds of 500-1000+ words per minute.

Instead of your eyes moving across lines of text, the text comes to you. Each word appears at the optimal focal point with the center character highlighted, maximizing reading efficiency.

## Features

### Core Reading
- Word-by-word display at screen center
- Center character highlighting for optimal focus
- Adjustable speed (50-1000 WPM)
- Multi-word chunks (1-5 words at a time)
- Context display (surrounding words preview)

### Intelligent Pacing
- **Slow start** - gradual speed increase over first 5 words to ease into reading
- **Smart micropauses** based on content type, punctuation, word length, and structure
  - Sentence-ending punctuation (.,!?): 2.5x delay
  - Other punctuation (;:,): 1.5x delay
  - Numbers and dates: 1.8x delay
  - Long words (>8 chars): 1.4x delay
  - Paragraph breaks: 2.5x delay
- **Heading-aware pauses** - longer pauses before H1 (2x), H2 (1.8x), H3 (1.5x), etc.
- **Callout-aware pauses** - visual separator and 2x delay for Obsidian callouts
- **Progressive acceleration** - gradually increase speed during reading session
- Default 400 WPM (comfortable range: 400-800 WPM with practice)
- All multipliers fully configurable

### Markdown Support
- Parses markdown syntax (links, bold, italic, code)
- Reads code block content
- **Obsidian callouts support** - displays with icons (üìù note, üí° tip, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning, etc.)
- **Proportional heading display** - H1 displayed 1.5x larger, H2 at 1.3x, H3 at 1.2x, etc.
- Visual separators before sections

### Contextual Navigation

- **Breadcrumb navigation** - shows your position in document structure (H1 ‚Ä∫ H2 ‚Ä∫ H3)
- Updates automatically as you read through sections
- Click any heading/callout in breadcrumb to jump to that section
- Callouts displayed with their respective icons in breadcrumb

### Smart Positioning
- **Click-to-start** - automatically begins reading from cursor position
- Tracks keyboard navigation in real-time
- Updates on cursor movement (arrows, page up/down, vim keys)
- Calculates accurate word position after markdown parsing

### Interface
- Adaptive dark/light mode
- Real-time progress bar
- Live statistics (words read, time elapsed, current WPM)
- Estimated reading time with accurate micropause calculation

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Shift+Space`: Play/Pause
- `‚Üê`: Rewind 10 words
- `‚Üí`: Forward 10 words
- `‚Üë`: Increase WPM (+25)
- `‚Üì`: Decrease WPM (-25)
- `Esc`: Stop
- `s`: Toggle statistics
